intro = "Hello, and thanks for reading this! I've tried to keep the Privacy Policy as short and simple as possible. This is where I explain how your personal data is collected, stored, and used, and waht happens to it when you're using Waterfall. Like with our User Agreement, I've put together two versions - the full, legalese version which is the legally binding one, and section summaries which I hope will make things a bit more accessible. You should read and agree to this before using the site! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the Discord, or email me."
bullets = "To summarise:

1. This explains what data is collected in connection with the site.
2. It also explains how the site uses the data, how it's stored, and how it's protected.
3. In short; 
    * In order to use the site, we need to process some of your data. Should processing need to happen for any purpose other than letting you use the site, you'll always be asked for consent in advance. 
    * For the most part, data is not transferred off the site, and it is never sold on to anyone. 
    * The site does use some Analytics tools that might handle data differently (but I'm working on phasing those out). 
4. Finally, it explains your rights in relation to your personal data.

Now that's over with, let's begin."
