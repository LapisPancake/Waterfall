# Contributing to Waterfall

Thanks for deciding to controbute to Waterfall!

This document contains a set of guidelines for contributing to Waterfall, its extensions, and its components. For the most part, these
are guidelines rather than rules. Use your best judgement, some common sense, and feel free to propose changes to this in a pull request. 

## Code of Conduct

As one exception to the "guidelines not rules" thing, read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I don't want to read all this, I just have a question about how to [x]

Please don't file an issue to ask a question, as different instances may operate a little differently. 

If you're using the "canonical" Waterfall instance, join the Discord. For spinoffs, ask the staff on those. 

## How can I contribute? 

There's a bunch of ways you can contribute! Finding and reporting bugs is a good option. It's also a great opportunity for new coders to get their hands dirty in fixing some of those. Improving the documentation is a good idea too. 

If you have more technical chops about you, helping to design Waterfall 2.0 is an option too. Join the Discord for that. 

If you're a new developer, check to see if there's any issues tagged "beginner" or "good first issue" - they'll help ease you in. For more of a challenge, look for stuff tagged "help wanted".
