# Contributing to Waterfall

Thanks for deciding to controbute to Waterfall!

This document contains a set of guidelines for contributing to Waterfall, its extensions, and its components. For the most part, these
are guidelines rather than rules. Use your best judgement, some common sense, and feel free to propose changes to this in a pull request. 

## Code of Conduct

As one exception to the "guidelines not rules" thing, read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I don't want to read all this, I just have a question about how to [x]

Please don't file an issue to ask a question, as different instances may operate a little differently. 

If you're using the "canonical" Waterfall instance, join the Discord. For spinoffs, ask the staff on those. 

## How can I contribute? 

There's a bunch of ways you can contribute! Finding and reporting bugs is a good option. It's also a great opportunity for new coders to get their hands dirty in fixing some of those. Improving the documentation is a good idea too. 

If you have more technical chops about you, helping to design Waterfall 2.0 is an option too. Join the Discord for that. 

If you're a new developer, check to see if there's any issues tagged "beginner" or "good first issue" - they'll help ease you in. For more of a challenge, look for stuff tagged "help wanted". 


### Branches

There's two important branches to keep an eye on - dev and main. 

The dev branch is where my own work is done, which gets pushed into main when I'm happy with something. 

Main is considered the testing build, and should be stuff that's relatively stable. Once everything is stability checked, this gets cloned into release branches and packaged up for people to use. 

The "main" branch is where any pull requests should be directed, and where anything low-impact should be cloned from. If you want to use the bleeding edge stuff, feel free to clone from an open PRs against dev instead. 

#### 2.0-dev 

Waterfall 2.0 is developed in this branch. Ignore this unless you're very sure you want to work on the overhaul.
